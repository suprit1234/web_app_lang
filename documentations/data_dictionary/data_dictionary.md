# Data Type Standard for IMIS

The following table outlines the data types used for IMIS and the standard conventions set that should be followed during future additional developments and maintenance of IMIS to ensure best practices. (reference: [PostgreSQL: Documentation: 15: Chapter 8.1 Numeric Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/datatype-numeric.html)):

Additionally, PostGIS extension is used as it greatly extends PostgreSQL's spatial capabilities and is essential for GIS (Geographic Information System) applications with advanced spatial capabilities, though it is not required for basic geometric operations. (reference: [PostGIS: Introduction to PostGIS: 9: Geometries 9.1 Introduction](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/geometries.html)):

Geometry: The base type for all geometric types which can store any geometry type.

| Geometry Type      | Description                                                                                 |            |         |                                |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Point              | Represents a single point.                                                                  |            |         |                                |
| LineString         | Represents a line defined by a collection of two or more points.                            |            |         |                                |
| Polygon            | Represents a polygonal area defined by one outer ring and zero or more inner rings (holes). |            |         |                                |
| MultiPoint         | A collection of multiple Point geometries.                                                  |            |         |                                |

# Postgres Naming Convention

## Conventions

Schema Name:

SQL identifiers and keywords must begin with a letter (a-z, but also letters with diacritical marks and non-Latin letters) or an underscore (\_). Subsequent characters in an identifier or keyword can be letters, underscores, digits (0-9), or dollar signs (\$).

Indexes:

The standard names for indexes in PostgreSQL are:

{tablename}_{columnname(s)}_{suffix}

where the suffix is one of the following:

-   pkey for a Primary Key constraint
-   key for a Unique constraint
-   excl for an Exclusion constraint
-   idx for any other kind of index
-   fkey for a foreign key
-   check for a Check constraint

Standard suffix for sequences is

-   seq for all sequences

## Demonstration

Create an index

create index my_table_column_a_idx on my_table(column_a);

Create a multicolumn index

create index my_table_column_a_column_b_idx on my_table(column_a, column_b);

Create a unique index

create unique index my_table_column_a_key on my_table(column_a);

Create a multicolumn unique index

create unique index my_table_column_a_column_b_key on my_table(column_a, column_b);
